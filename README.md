# Employee Directory App
Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory App

Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Project 5

**Main Project Goals**

  - Work with a public API, make API requests, and asynchronously handle the data 
    that will be returned from your requests and displayed in your employee directory app.

  - Other than JS or jQuery, do not use any other frameworks, libraries or plugins to create 
    the necessary functionality for this project.

**Note to Reviewer concerning Extra Credit:** 

I have added a box shadow to the employee card divs.
